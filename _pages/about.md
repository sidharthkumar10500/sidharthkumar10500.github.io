<font face="helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">I am a PhD student working with Prof. <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/">Jon Tamir</a> at University of Texas Austin since September 2020. Before that at UT Austin, I worked with Prof. 
 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=17Ko8Q0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Robert Heath</a> on low-resolution DACs.
I did my B.Tech and MS from the <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>, India. 
My current research focus is on designing new methods to speed up the reconstruction of magnetic resonance images using signal processing and deep learning methods.
